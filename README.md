A Julia prototype implementation of the Dice probabilistic programming language.
See [https://github.com/SHoltzen/dice](https://github.com/SHoltzen/dice)


## Installation

Install Julia 1.7 or higher using [these instructions](https://julialang.org/downloads/platform/).

Clone the repository and start julia in project mode for current folder:
```bash
cd Dice.jl
julia --project
```

Install Dice and update dependencies (one can also use `precompile` or `build`):

```
] up
```

Press CTRL-C or backspace to exit from the pkg terminal and return to Julia REPL.

One can now run a program from the Julia REPL:
```julia
include("examples/graph_reachability.jl")
```

Or from the command line:
```
julia --project examples/graph_reachability.jl
```

FIX  
DistUInt takes in a value that indicates the range of probabilities (such as through a vector of coin flips or an integer) and returns a discrete distribution that includes the probability for each integer value.
You can specify the bit size with {}.
